failed with message:
	Species Tb has not been defined
The correct usage of this command is described below:
	ion <species-id> <x0> <x1> <x2> <moveScale> [<constraint type>=HyperPlane|Linear|None|Planar <d0> <d1> <d2>]
Add an atom of species <species-id> at coordinates (<x0>,<x1>,<x2>).

<moveScale> preconditions the motion of this ion (set 0 to hold fixed)

In addition, the ion may be constrained to a line or a plane with line
direction or plane normal equal to (<d0>,<d1>,<d2>) in the coordinate
system selected by command coords-type. Note that the constraints must
be consistent with respect to symmetries (if enabled).
